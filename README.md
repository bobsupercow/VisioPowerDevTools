# Visio Power Dev Tools

This is a library of code for Microsoft Visio which can be used for Visio Addins

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
While you could integrate this into your own project, it is designed as a shared library, so typical deployment would be compiling to .dll and adding it as a reference.

### Prerequisites

To compile, you need to install the Microsoft Visio 2016 SDK and add the Office and Visio Interop references to your project. 

### Installing

Download. Add. Compile.

## Documentation

This was originally written for Visio 2007, then updated for Visio 2010 and 2013. 
It originally used GhostDoc / Sandcastle for documentation but I haven't updated it for a more modern solution.
